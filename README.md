Topic: K1C images (DSLR & Keyence) classification into three classes. DSLR images are easier to get. We are supposed to develop a method to classifiy the DSLR images or Keyence images. If this method performs simialr in these two kinds of images, it means DSLR method is enough and we don't need to take Keyence iamges anymore, which can save time and laybor.
