Ideas: 

ML vs. DL: 100 images is a relatively small dataset for deep learning, especially when dealing with complex image classification tasks. Deep learning models tend to perform better with larger datasets. Insufficient data can lead to overfitting, where the model essentially memorizes the training data rather than learning meaningful patterns.

Machine-learning method: 
- [ ] Using Open-cv to select the features from the images: the percentage of the cracks area, shape, ...
- [ ] try different ML methods like K-means, KNN, DBSDAN to find the best way to cluster these features.

Data clean: 
- [ ] match the crack and non-crack part
- [ ] calculate related parameters
